# Raspberry_PI_NAS
Basic Script that Sets up a Raspberry PI with Open Media Vault so the PI can be used as a NAS
***
> In order to use the script for your system, network, and specific PI.
You will have to manually adjust the name of the PI and the Username and Password of the root user of the PI

Note: I wrote this to be run from a Linux machine. I work on Manjaro so some changes to the installation of 'sshpass' will also need to be made
        this includes users for Ubuntu and Debian something like 'sudo apt install sshpass'
